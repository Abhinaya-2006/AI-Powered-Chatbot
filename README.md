This project is an AI-Powered Chatbot built using Streamlit and Google’s Gemini API, offering intelligent conversations through both text and image-based inputs. It includes a secure login/signup authentication system and delivers smooth, responsive interaction via a clean Streamlit interface. The chatbot integrates seamlessly with Gemini for AI-generated responses, enabling translation, explanation, and image understanding features. Importantly, the API key is deliberately excluded from the repository to maintain security and privacy, ensuring the project remains both professional and deployment-ready.
